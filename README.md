# VerreTech e-Commerce Site   

## Presentation of the project

This project was realized by Boime Benoit, Cao Soria, Keiff Julien and Spick Florian during their studies at CESI Alternance in Nancy. The goal of this project is to design an e-commerce website but also to have a whole project management and our time. A microservice architecture was chosen to carry out this project


## Set up the project

First of all you will have to get the code, for that:

`git clone git@github.com:florianspk/Batavik.git`

Once you have retrieved the code, you must access the file 

`cd Batavik`

> Now we will install the application for this you should have **npm** If you don't have npm you can see here how to install it: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
{.is-warning}

Now you can run

`npm i -g @iryu54/stack-monitor`

Once the execution is finished we will install npm

`npm install`

We have also set up an administrator interface to have visibility on each microservice 
Once the execution is finished we will install npm.
To have access to this interface you just have to do : 

`npm run stack`
